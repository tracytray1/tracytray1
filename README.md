Hi, I'm Tracy, also known as Tracy-Tray, and I'm based in Hamburg. Previously, I worked as an SEO Content Manager, but I recently decided to embark on a new journey: Web Development.

Why the switch? As someone with a constant stream of ideas, I see Web Development as an incredibly fulfilling way to:

* Bring my ideas to life: I can finally translate my concepts into tangible, interactive experiences.
* Express myself creatively: Coding provides a unique and powerful medium for self-expression.
* Find mental clarity: Building projects would help me organize my thoughts and declutter my mind.
