Hi, I'm Tracy, also known as Tracy-Tray, and I'm based in Hamburg. Previously, I worked as an SEO Content Manager, but I recently decided to embark on a new journey: Web Development.

Why the switch? As someone with a constant stream of ideas, I see Web Development as a way to:

* Bring my ideas to life: I can finally translate my concepts into something tangible.
* Solve problems creatively: I love the challenge of breaking down complex issues and finding smart, efficient solutions through code.
* Find mental clarity: Building projects would help me organize my thoughts and declutter my mind.
